# MalwoArmor
An app to protect elderly people's devices from getting hacked

#About

This was a school project made by two people. It basically protects elderly people from clicking suspicious links and getting infected with adware and viruses. It has an integrated chat bot in the left hand corner. Here we can talk to the chat bot about certain things. Though it is limited right now in future we have plans of integrating AI in the chat bot.

#How does it work?

We have a database about malicious websites. The code then scans through this database and if the link autofilled/manually filled matches any entry in the database then it stops the user from opening the website. In future adding features such as blocking that pesky allow notifications pop up are also being thought of.

#What do i have to do?

It is mostly an automatically process except clicking the check website button. For the best automatic experience it is recommended that the default browser is changed to MalwoArmor. This doesn't mean that chrome cannot be opened though before starting a link it always gives an option to open with chrome or MalwoArmor

#How to change default browser?

It is quite simple to do it you have to:-
1)Open settings and search default apps

-->If no default apps comes up then open apps and click the 3 dots on the top right hand side. Some options will come after this and you can click on default apps here.

2)After scrolling down there will come browser tab click on it and change it to MalwoArmor and we're done.
